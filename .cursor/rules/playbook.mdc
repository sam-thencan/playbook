- Use Supabase Auth (email/password) for login and progress tracking.
- Lessons: Intro + Days 1–30 + Bonus; each includes title, slug, rich body, resource links, estimated time, optional CTA.
- Track per-user lesson completion with streaks and milestone-based rewards (e.g., after Day 7 → offer a free SEO Strategy Video).
- Offers include: call bookings, downloads, discounts — unlockable based on lesson day or % complete.
- Admin dashboard allows CRUD of lessons and offers.
- UI style: minimal white cards, neutral background, orange CTA accents (#ef6a47), radius 10px.
- Font: Poppins preferred; fallback: system-ui, sans-serif.
- Use Tailwind for styling.
- Component architecture should include: Card, Button, ProgressRing, Pill, Modal, Table.
- Use the daily format: The courses are broken down by days — lessons should follow that flow.
- Code should be split per feature folder (`/dashboard`, `/lesson`, `/admin`, etc.).
- Prioritize accessibility: semantic HTML, focus states, keyboard nav.
- Route structure:
  - `/dashboard`: progress ring, next lesson, resume
  - `/lesson/[slug]`: lesson reader view
  - `/admin/*`: lesson/offer management
